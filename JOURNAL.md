## 10/25/2025 - decided what it will be like  

I've decided to make a 3d printer
I want it to be coreXY with a relatively large build volume
for less than $350
I also want it to be somewhat fast but it must be precise too.

figured out how coreXY worked with a mockup of the mechanism.
Researched parts to find how it would work for a reasonable price
decided that I wanted auto bed leveling and calibration


  

## 10/26/2025 8 PM - met with Tacomakes3D  

I met with [Tacomakes3D](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/users/2462) to find out how this project should be done 
through his guidance i was able to better define what i wanted this to be like
he also helped me with deciding how it should work

## 10/30/2025 - did a whole ton of cad  

cadded frame, coreXY, Z axis
worked more on what parts i want in including the motors (nema 17 60mm)
especially the belt tensioner was fun
will work on mates next![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njg0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb16cae64d2152a09dd2defbafefc8e93e8dbc51/image.png)
  

## 11/2/2025 - More cad  

I replaced the 2020 extrusions with 2040 extrusions.
I also reworked the mates
also I researched different extruder and heatbed options, many of which are too expensive, so i will have to find something cheaper.
