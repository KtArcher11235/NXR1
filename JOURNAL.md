## 10/25/2025 - decided what it will be like  

I've decided to make a 3d printer
I want it to be coreXY with a relatively large build volume
for less than $350
I also want it to be somewhat fast but it must be precise too.

figured out how coreXY worked with a mockup of the mechanism.
Researched parts to find how it would work for a reasonable price
decided that I wanted auto bed leveling and calibration
