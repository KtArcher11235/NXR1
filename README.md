# NXR1
**NXR (Not eXactly Reliable)** is a simple coreXY 3d printer designrd to be cheep but kindah ok.
It's the first 3d printer that I'm making so expect it to be mid.
Using a tried and true extruder fro mand ender 3, combined with the powerfull bambulab p1s hotend, this printer is able to tackle fast and acurite printing. sometimes.
