# NXR1
**NXR (Not eXactly Reliable)** is a simple coreXY 3d printer designed to be cheep but kindah ok.
<br>
It's the first 3d printer that I'm making so expect it to be mid.
<br>
Using a tried and true extruder for an ender 3, combined with the powerful Bambu lab p1s hotend, this printer is able to tackle fast and accurate printing. sometimes.<br>
