# NXR1
**NXR (Not eXactly Reliable)** is a simple coreXY 3d printer designed to be cheep but kindah ok.
<br>
It's the first 3d printer that I'm making so expect it to be mid.
<br>
Using a tried and true extruder for an ender 3, combined with the powerful Bambu lab p1s hotend, this printer is able to tackle fast and accurate printing. sometimes.<br>

## building
in order to build the nxr1 you will need the parts in the BOM (see BOM.csv)  
using the cad as refrence, build the parts in the folowing order,  
The bottom frame  
The top core xy system  
The hotend  
The belts  
everything else  

  Order is not too important in these steps, just use common sense to determine how to asemble with cad as refrence.
