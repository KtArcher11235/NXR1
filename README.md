# NXR1
**NXR (Not eXactly Reliable)** is a simple coreXY 3d printer designed to be cheep but kindah ok.
<br>
It's the first 3d printer that I'm making so expect it to be mid.
<br>
Using a tried and true extruder for an ender 3, combined with the powerful Bambu lab p1s hotend, this printer is able to tackle fast and accurate printing. sometimes.<br>

## building
in order to build the nxr1 you will need the parts in the BOM (see BOM.csv)  
using the cad as refrence, build the parts in the folowing order,  
### The bottom frame  
  asemble the extrusions with the L brackets and then the 3d printed ones. Add feet. also make sure to find where the nuts will be required later and put them there NOW.
### z rails and bed
add the 3d prints, motors rails, etc. as it is in the cad.
### The top core xy system  
use 3d prints to build the frame out of extrusion, then add the linear slides and moving parts.
### The hotend  
asemble according to the cad with glue, screws, tape, or whatever meets vour fancy.
### The belts  
wind the belts around the system as shown in the cad
### everything else 
electronics, spool holder, etc. Again, look at the CAD.
### notes
Order is not too important in these steps, just use common sense to determine how to asemble with cad as refrence.
